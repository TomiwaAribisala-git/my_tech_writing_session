# Tech (Writing) Editing
Tech (writing) editing is a collboarative process with authors, who are subject matter experts to check
the correctness of aspects such as specialized terminology, matchups between textual and visual elements, 
as well as more traditional aspects of writing. 
- Procedures of Tech Editing:
    1. Consistency and Correctness: spelling, punctuation, grammar, word use, page numbering, color consistency.
    2. Visual Readability: sizes, tables, captions, graphic elements locations, lists, document layout.
    3. Content and Structure: sentence structures, logical flaws, image appropriateness, navigability,
    working hyperlinks, section breaks, order of contents, overall meaning. 
- Editing Resources/Parameters:
    1. Style Guides: an exisiting, authoritative source that lays out rules for the materials you are 
    editing e.g. an handbook; always be prepared to justify your edits with a style guide reference. 
    2. Style Sheets: small-scale, local style guides that provide consistent quick-reference answers
    to common errors/problems. 
    3. Headings: use plenty of headings, perhaps one heading for every two or three paragraphs.
    4. Lists: numbered lists to show sequence, order or hierarchy, bulleted list can appear in any order. 
    5. Notices: specially formattated chunks of text that alert readers to special points, exceptions, 
    potential problems, or danger. 
    6. Figures: illustrations, drawings, schematics, photos and other visual elements. 
    7. Tables: look for repeating pairs, triples or quadruplets of item that can be formatted as tables;
    a series of terms and definitions is an example for tables.
    8. Highlighting: bold text, italics, alternate fonts, quotation marks, capital letters and other 
    typographical tricks. 
    9. Margins, Indentation and Alignment. 
    10. Fonts and Color: limit the no. of fonts that appear in a document to two(headings/body text), 
    consider compability of background color, text color, heading color, figures color and table titles
    color; mostly stick with black text on a white background. 
    11. Genres and Conventions: all genres of writing adhere to certain conventions, in terms of content,
    the style of language used to express the content, and how the content is presented visually. An example is am online news article, you will often notice consistent formatting features; replicate that for your 
    tech writing and make sure it conforms to the expectations of the genre and audience, and that most 
    importantly convey the message you want to send.

# Notes 
1. Your first draft is only a base for future documentation, create it as it's comfortable for you. Always 
revisit and write until you have everything you want about the topic.
2. You have to know your specific audience -- intended readers when doing tech writing, you must not aim at 
everyone. You must write for your audience, and adapt your writing to meet their needs, goals and expectations 
for the document. Gain information about your audience problems by surveys, questionnares, audience feedback, 
personal experience, popular opinions, analytics and online interviews. 
3. Write about your audience pain-points, empathize with them, break the pain-points down into manageable
points to show that you understand them, and immediately hook them by providing your solutions.
4. You must ensure that you provide relevant and right information your audience expects to see in your documentation. Write succintly and clearly, straight to the point, avoid redundancies/distractions, use an active writing voice. 
5. If you must use technical terms in your documentation, ensure they are neccessary. You can include a definition section in your document to help your readers through understanding your technical terms. 
6. Avoid long sentences; average length of a sentence should be 15-20 words. You can always break your sentence into two if you feel it is too long. You write to teach, not to entertain, convince or inspire. 
7. Make your document visually appealing; use high-quality visuals and pictorial representations, visuals 
that best represent the information and determine the right places to include them. 
8. When you edit technical materials, do not simply insert corrections unless the edits are simple or you have 
explicit permission to make final decisions, instead write comments to the author and suggest changes. 
9. State how your audience should relate to Notices in your writing:
- Under what conditions they should use the notice,
- What will happen if they ignore the notice,
- How to recover if they ignore the notice.
 Put Notices in two places:
- Before the step in which the potential problem exists.
- At the beginning of the entire procedure. 
10. If you document incorporates sources you will want to do an additional pass to make sure that all sources are cited properly and are in chronological order in the body text, and that they cross-reference to your list of references at the end of the document.
